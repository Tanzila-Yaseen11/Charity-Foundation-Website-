# Charity Foundation Website 🌟
I’m excited to share my latest project—a fully responsive Charity Foundation website built using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap! 🎉

This website covers all essential pages for a charity organization:

## 🏠 Home: 
A warm welcome with a hero section and quick links to important areas.
## 🙌 About: 
Learn more about the foundation's mission and vision.
## 📝 Blog: 
A dynamic space for news and updates.
## 👥 Staff: 
Meet the incredible team behind the organization.
## 💡 Causes:
A showcase of the causes we’re passionate about.
## 📅 Events: 
Stay updated on upcoming charity events.
## 📞 Contact Us: 
Get in touch easily with a sleek, user-friendly contact form.

#### Each page is carefully designed to be responsive across all devices for a smooth user experience, no matter where you’re browsing from! 📱💻
